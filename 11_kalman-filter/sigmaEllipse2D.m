function xy = sigmaEllipse2D( mu, Sigma, level, npoints )
%SIGMAELLIPSE2D generates x,y-points which lie on the ellipse describing
% a sigma level in the Gaussian density defined by mean and covariance.
%
%Input:
%   MU          [2 x 1] Mean of the Gaussian density
%   SIGMA       [2 x 2] Covariance matrix of the Gaussian density
%   LEVEL       Which sigma level curve to plot. Can take any positive value,
%               but common choices are 1, 2 or 3. Default = 3.
%   NPOINTS     Number of points on the ellipse to generate. Default = 32.
%
%Output:
%   XY          [2 x npoints] matrix. First row holds x-coordinates, second
%               row holds the y-coordinates. First and last columns should
%               be the same point, to create a closed curve.


%Setting default values, in case only mu and Sigma are specified.
